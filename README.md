# accel
This is a depository for the accelerometer program I'm working on.

Program requirements:
1- python2 and python3
2- SQLite3
4- modules: statistics, matplotlib, numpy, SQLite3, csv, pathlib

Instructions:
1- save the accelerometer data in the program folder
2- open the terminal
3- enter the python2 environment
4- run the cwa1.py file with the accelerometer file (python2 cwa1.py RT100steps.cwa)
5- This should produce an SQLite database for the accelerometer file.
6- now enter the python3 environment
7- run the accel.py file
